# Compound interest graphic calculator

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
Live site (on Githubpages): [Here](https://alfaruga.github.io/compoundInterestCalc/)
Alternative Azure AppServices: [Here](https://compound-interest-calc.azurewebsites.net/)

## Practice project 

Some basic stuff:

<ul>
<li>Passing props</li>
<li>Two way binding</li>
<li>Using hook of state (updatating and creating state)</li>
<li>Forms</li>
<li>Rendering conditional contents and styles</li>

</ul>
## Notes
It should be worth noticing that some styles are not 100% ready, after 10 years of investment the green box that shows the return of investment and yearly interest gets distorted.
I could show them only when hovering over the bars, but I still don't know how to do that using react.
